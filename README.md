# Vendor Performance Analysis

As an aspiring data analyst, I wanted to explore how businesses manage vendor relationships and optimize procurement decisions. 
This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using real-world inspired data, combining Python and SQL for in-depth analysis and Power BI for interactive business reporting.

---

## Objective

The aim of this project was to:

- Clean and transform procurement data using Python  
- Derive key vendor and inventory performance metrics  
- Build a Power BI dashboard to visualize procurement efficiency  
- Simulate decision-making scenarios in vendor and stock management  

---

## Tools Used

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – For data cleaning, KPI calculation, and EDA  
- **Power BI** – For dashboard development and data storytelling  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQLite3** – Python libraries used for data analysis  
- **Excel** – For intermediate formatting and Power BI import  
- **GitHub** – To version and host the project  

---

## KPIs and Metrics Explored

The analysis focused on business-critical metrics such as:

- **Purchase Contribution (%)** – Vendor's share in total purchases  
- **Return Rate** – Return quantity as a % of total sold quantity  
- **Freight Cost per Unit Sold** – Efficiency of vendor logistics  
- **Category-wise Sales Volume & Value**  
- **Vendor Efficiency Score** – Based on contribution vs. returns  
- **Revenue Potential** – Forecasted based on quantity and selling price  
- **Discount Efficiency** – MRP vs selling price across categories  

These KPIs are crucial for procurement strategy, cost control, and vendor evaluation.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

Performed using Python (Pandas) in Jupyter Notebooks:

- Removed transactions with **zero quantity**  
- Converted MRP values from **paise to rupees**  
- Created **return rate**, **freight efficiency**, and **contribution** columns  
- Standardized column formats and filtered for relevant transactions  
- Used cleaned CSVs for Power BI dashboard

---

## Key Business Questions Explored

- Which vendors contribute the most to overall purchases?  
- Which vendors have the highest return rates?  
- Are there inefficiencies in freight spend by vendor or product?  
- Which categories perform best in terms of sales and discounts?  
- How can procurement be optimized using cost/efficiency metrics?  

These questions guided the entire analytics pipeline and dashboard design.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard allows business users to explore:

### Vendor Leaderboard
- Top vendors by contribution, return %, and freight efficiency  

### Product Performance
- Category-level insights and discount trends  

### Procurement Overview
- Total purchase value, sales quantity, and vendor comparisons
